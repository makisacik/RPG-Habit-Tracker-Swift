## Purpose of the Project

The purpose of this project is to create an App Store application that will help users to build their habits, but with a concept of RPG game structure so that user can gamify their lives with concepts such as main quests, side quests, optional quests, and repetitive quests. The app will offer good practice on building iOS apps. It will be built with SwiftUI, MVVM, clean architecture and dependency injection.

## Testability
The app will be designed with testability in mind through the use of abstractions achieved by protocols/interfaces and the dependency injection technique. Although I’m not implementing TDD (Test-Driven Development) as it's currently a solo project, I will write tests for critical components and make the app scalable for future testing.

## Key Features

**RPG Gamification**: Users can manage their daily tasks as "quests," which are categorized into main quests, side quests, optional quests, and repetitive quests.

**Quest Management**: Includes functionality to add, track, and complete quests, with a visual representation of progress.

**Widgets**: Interactive widgets will be created to keep users engaged and remind them of their progress, making it easy to access quests and character status directly from the home screen. This is also important to remind the user that they downloaded this app.

**Character Creation**: Users create a character that represents their in-app persona, enhancing engagement.

**Notifications**: Timely notifications to remind users about their quests and encourage them to maintain consistency in completing tasks.


## What Makes This App Different from Existing Apps in the App Store?

This app should stand out due to its unique combination of habit tracking and RPG mechanics. While many habit trackers and productivity apps exist, few take an approach that transforms habit formation into a gamified experience with RPG elements. Users won’t just complete tasks, instead they’ll embark on quests, develop their character, and receive rewards, creating a sense of achievement and progression.
